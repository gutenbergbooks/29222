<h3>THE</h3>

<h1>PRINCE OF PARTHIA</h1>


<h2><i>A TRAGEDY</i></h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>



<h3 class="gap6"><a name="THOMAS_GODFREY_JR" id="THOMAS_GODFREY_JR"></a>THOMAS GODFREY,
<span class="smcap">Jr.</span></h3>

<h4>(1736-1763)</h4>


<p>Thomas Godfrey, Jr., was born in Philadelphia, on December 4, 1736,
the son of a man who himself won fame as an inventor of the Quadrant.
Godfrey, Senior, was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, the two probably
having been drawn together by their common interest in science. When
Godfrey, Senior, died, December, 1749, it was Franklin who wrote his
obituary notice.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Young Godfrey was a student at the College or Academy of Philadelphia,
and when his education was completed, he became apprenticed to a
watch-maker, remaining in that profession until 1758. As a student at
the Academy, he came under the special influence of Dr. William Smith,
the first Principal or Provost of that institution,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and it was Dr.
Smith who not only obtained for Godfrey a lieutenancy with the
Pennsylvania troops in 1758, which sent him in the expedition against
Fort Duquesne, but who, likewise, as the Editor of <i>The American
Magazine</i>, was only too glad to accept and publish some of Godfrey's
poetical effusions.</p>

<p>That the young man was popular, and that he associated with some of
the most promising figures of the time, will be seen from the fact
that, although he was only twenty-seven when he died, he was counted
among the friends of Benjamin West and John Green, both portrait
painters, of Francis Hopkinson, who was a student at the College of
Philadelphia, and of Nathaniel Evans, a young minister whose loyalty
found outlet after Godfrey's death in the Memorial Edition of
Godfrey's works. Evans himself wrote poems and dialogues. In his
confirmation of the fact that, as a poet, Godfrey was regarded
favourably by the Philadelphians of the time, he quotes from the diary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>of one Miss Sarah Eve, who referred to him as "our poet."</p>

<p>Godfrey's reputation, as a young man with musical talents and a
decided taste for painting, has come down to us. Certain it is that,
during all of this time of varied occupation as a watch-maker and a
soldier, he must have been courting the poetic Muse. There are some
who speculate, without authority, on his having been a theatre-goer,
and having become inspired as a playwright by the work of the American
Company, in Philadelphia; especially by the good work of Douglass.
Because of insufficient evidence, that is a question which remains
unproven. Nevertheless, it is certain, from an extant letter written
by Godfrey on November 17, 1759, and quoted by Seilhamer, that he must
have had his attention turned to playwriting as a special art. He says
to his correspondent, writing from North Carolina:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By the last vessel from this place, I sent you the copy of a
tragedy I finished here, and desired your interest in bringing
it on the stage; I have not yet heard of the vessel's safe
arrival, and believe if she is safe it will be too late for the
company now in Philadelphia. [Meaning, of course, Douglass's
company.]</p></div>

<p>There are two facts to be noted in this communication: first, that it
was written from North Carolina, where, in 1759, Godfrey had gone on
some plantation business&mdash;probably as factor; and second, that it must
have been penned with the idea of immediate production by the actors
in Philadelphia. According to Seilhamer, Godfrey remained in North
Carolina for three years. He did not write the entire manuscript of
"The Prince of Parthia" while living in the South but, as he
definitely states in his letter, finished it soon after his arrival.</p>

<p>There is no evidence as to why Godfrey sailed to the Island of New
Providence in the last year of his life, and then returned to
Wilmington, N.C. There is no definite statement as to whether he
contracted fever and had a sunstroke on that expedition, or after his
return home. But, nevertheless, he did contract the fever and have a
sunstroke; with the result that he succumbed to his illness, and died
near Wilmington, North Carolina, on August 3, 1763.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>After his death, Godfrey's friends decided among themselves that the
young man was too much of a genius for them to allow his productions
to remain scattered and unrecognized. Evidently, correspondence
regarding this must have taken place between Dr. Smith, Nathaniel
Evans, the young minister, and John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Green, the portrait painter. For,
in 1765, a book was published, entitled "Juvenile Poems on Various
Subjects, with the Prince of Parthia," printed in Philadelphia by one
Henry Miller.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The volume contained a life written by Evans, a
critical estimate written by Dr. Smith, of the College of
Philadelphia, and an Elegy from the pen of John Green, who had been
previously complimented by Godfrey in a poem entitled "A Night Piece."
The whole spirit of the publication was one of friendly devotion and
of firm belief in the permanency of Godfrey's position in the literary
world. As was the custom of the time, the Edition was issued under the
patronage of subscribers, a list being included. We know, for example,
that Benjamin Franklin subscribed for twelve copies, his own private,
autographed copy having been put on sale a few years ago.</p>

<p>As yet, no concerted effort had been made for the production of
Godfrey's "The Prince of Parthia." We do not know if, during this
time, the American Company had any claim on the manuscript, or
whether, after Godfrey's death, it was again submitted to the
theatrical people. But this much we do know, that, very hastily, the
American Company, headed by David Douglass, who was playing at the
Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia, decided that they would put on "The
Prince of Parthia" in place of "The Disappointment; or, the Force of
Credulity," a comic opera which will be noted in my introduction to
John Leacock's "The Fall of British Tyranny." This musical piece had
actually been put into rehearsal in 1767, when it was withdrawn.
Immediately, the <i>Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser</i> for
April 23, 1767, contained an advertisement of the forthcoming
production; it ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By Authority./Never Performed before./By the American
Company,/at the New Theatre, in Southwark,/On Friday, the
Twenty-fourth of April, will be/presented, A Tragedy written by
the late ingenious/Mr. <i>Thomas Godfrey</i>, of this city, called
the/Prince of Parthia./The Principal Characters by Mr.
Hallam,/Mr. Douglass, Mr. Wall, Mr. Morris,/Mr. Allyn, Mr.
Tomlinson, Mr. Broad/belt, Mr. Greville, Mrs. Douglass,/Mrs.
Morris, Miss Wainwight, and/Miss Cheer./To which will be added,
A Ballad Opera called/The Contrivances./To begin exactly at
<i>Seven o'clock</i>.&mdash;<i>Vivant Rex &amp; Regina.</i>/</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, for the same date, appears an
advertisement, without the cast of characters.</p>

<p>The production occurred on April 24, 1767.</p>

<p>Seilhamer gives a probable cast of characters, although only the list
of actors is given in the advertisement. Apart from this, little is
known of the production: whether or not it pleased the theatre-goers
of the time. We can judge, however, from the reading of the play
itself, that there was little of extreme dramatic excellence in the
situations, the chief claim, from the actor's point of view, being the
opportunity to deliver certain very highly coloured, poetical lines
modelled after the manner of the Elizabethan drama.</p>

<p>In the publication of "The Prince of Parthia," we have the first
printed American tragedy in existence, and in its production we have
one of only two plays, written by Americans, and presented on the
stage before the Revolution. The other play is George Cockings's "The
Conquest of Canada; or, The Siege of Quebec," printed for the author
in 1766, and presented in Philadelphia in 1773. We note, in Dr. F. W.
Atkinson's estimable Bibliography of American Plays in his possession,
that Cockings later described himself as "Camillo Querno, Poet
Laureate to Congress."</p>

<p>The interest in the early history of the American drama, which has
become evident within recent years, and nowhere more evident than
among the student body in our American colleges, induced the
Zelosophic Literary Society, encouraged by the University of
Pennsylvania, to revive "The Prince of Parthia," which was written by
one of their alumni. The production was consummated on March 26, 1915.
Even though we have no statement as to the actual manner in which the
Douglass Company presented the play originally, we are given every
evidence, by those who witnessed the revival, that the play, while
containing many excellences, was not of a dramatic character according
to modern ideas of stage effectiveness.</p>

<p>The only portrait of Godfrey known to have been in existence was that
painted by Benjamin West, in his earlier years. It is interesting to
note that in commemoration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary
of the original production of this play, Dr. Archibald Henderson, of
the University of North Carolina, issued an <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i> of "The
Prince of Parthia," with an extended introduction, historical,
biographical and critical (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1917).</p>

<p>Our Author has made Use of the <i>licentia poetica</i> in the Management of
this Dramatic Piece; and deviates, in a particular or two, from what
is agreed on by Historians: The Queen <i>Thermusa</i> being not the Wife of
King <i>Artabanus</i>, but (according to <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Strabo</i> and
<i>Josephus</i>) of <i>Phraates</i>; <i>Artabanus</i> being the fourth King of
<i>Parthia</i> after him. Such Lapses are not unprecedented among the
Poets; and will the more readily admit of an Excuse, when the Voice of
History is followed in the Description of Characters.</p>

<span class="i0">Drooping genius of my soul; thus, let me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasp thee, in my aged arms; yes, I will live&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, to support thee in thy kingly rights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when thou 'rt firmly fix'd, my task's perform'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My honourable task&mdash;Then I'll retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Petition gracious heav'n to bless my work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the silent grave forget my cares.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now, to the Temple, let us onward move,<br /></span>
